# AIRBNB DATA ANALYSIS - BOSTON AND SEATTLE

Airbnb is an online community marketplace that allows homeowners to list their bedrooms, apartments or their entire homes for short term lodging. It has become a global holiday phenomenon spreading to every major city in the world, as people can travel to new places and stay at ready-to-go homes at a reasonable price. As Forbes states, *in collaborative consumption, the sharing economy or the peer economy, owners rent out something they are not using, such as a car, house or bicycle to a stranger using a peer-to-peer service. The company typically has a rating or review system so people on both sides of the transaction can trust the other. With the popularity of these services, many people don't need to buy when they can rent from others*

However, despite being the poster child for the sharing economy, Airbnb also has its share of controversies. All across the world from the US to Europe and beyond, city authorities are either clamping down on Airbnb because of cases of either flouting local laws (in New York owners or tenants cannot legally rent their apartments out for short periods (less than 30 days) unless they are also living in the property), avoiding taxes, or inadvertently raising housing prices (in Berlin, Airbnb has been partly blamed for increasing rents, city officials have created a new housing law banning regular short-term letting of rooms without permission from the authorities). 

This post will attempt to analyse the Airbnb data for Boston and Seattle as available on Kaggle.
